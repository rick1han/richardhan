                    height="395"> The concept of ElasticOS is shown in
                  the Figure.&nbsp; We are motivated by the trend
                  towards cloud computing, wherein large data centers
                  contain many racks of machines that are available for
                  rental on demand by server applications processing big
                  data and handling large volumes of network traffic and
                  I/O.&nbsp; Current approaches to elasticity, such as
                  elastic load balancers, require the application
                  developer to be explicitly aware of elasticity,
                  incorporating extra scripting logic into their
                  programs to spawn extra virtual machines when the load
                  reaches a certain threshold.&nbsp; Moreover, the
                  application developer is forced to manually
                  synchronize the application state between the multiple
                  VM instances.<br>
                  <br>
                  Instead, we aspire towards an approach whereby the
                  application developer is largely unaware of whether
                  their application server is running on one machine or
                  a thousand machines.&nbsp; Application developers
                  should focus on developing application logic and
                  functionality, while the OS underneath the application
                  will automatically and elastically scale to "stretch"
                  a process or thread simultaneously across many
                  machines. <br>
                  <br>
                  We achieve stretching of virtual memory by creating an
                  <i>elastic page table</i> (see paper), wherein thread
                  execution can jump between nodes and operate on data
                  pages in the address space that are partitioned or
                  sharded across different nodes.&nbsp; In this way, we
                  hope to exploit locality within a thread as well as
                  concurrency across threads in order to group or
                  cluster data pages together on the same node that are
                  being accessed together in time.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  Note that our approach is the opposite of distributed
                  shared memory (DSM), i.e. in ElasticOS data pages are
                  sharded across different machines and execution moves
                  towards a single page of data, whereas in DSM data
                  page copies move towards execution.&nbsp; As a result,
                  we can see that ElasticOS is "reverse DSM" and has the
                  useful scalability property that N writes to a data
                  page by N threads, each on a different machine, will
                  cause 2N context jumps to and from the machine where
                  the data page is placed, compared to N<sup>2</sup>
                  consistency/coherency messages in DSM.&nbsp; We think
                  this linear property will make the ElasticOS approach
                  much more scalable.<br>
                  <br>
                  Our approach also differs from Single System Image
                  (SSI) cluster or grid operating systems, like
                  Kerrighed and Xtreem OS, as well as earlier efforts
                  like MOSIX, open MOSIX and Linux PMI, which use full
                  process migration.&nbsp; These approaches move a
                  process from one machine to another to spread load,
                  but are limited by the resources on the one machine
                  where the process is executed, in contrast to our
                  approach which stretches a process or thread
                  simultaneously across multiple nodes to jointly and
                  concurrently exploit the memory, CPU and networking of
                  other machines.&nbsp; SSI approaches also tend to use
                  some form of DSM, which suffer from the limitations
                  noted earlier.<br>
                  <br>
                  Our vision of Elastic OS extends beyond elasticizing
                  memory, and includes elasticizing CPU and network I/O
                  resources.&nbsp; That is, just as a large in-memory
                  database application should be able to expand and take
                  advantage of additional memory available on other rack
                  machines, then a network-intensive server such as a
                  Web server should be able to take advantage of the
                  additional NICs on other machines, and a
                  compute-intensive job should be able to take advantage
                  of the extra cores on other rack machines.<br>
                  <br>
                  We are currently integrating our approach towards
                  elasticity into the Linux kernel.&nbsp; Among the
                  future topics of research that we intend to explore
                  are:<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Adaptive page placement policies</li>
                    <li>Elastic I/O<br>

                    <li>Fault tolerance</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>We welcome feedback and participation, and are
                    excited about the potential for this research
                    project.<br>
